### 注意事项
* To simplify this code lab as much as possible, we've used localStorage,which is not ideal for production apps because it is a blocking,synchronous storage mechanism that is potentially very slow on some devices.
* The second way to test is via Web Server for Chrome. With this approach, you expose your local development server (on your desktop or laptop) to other computers, and then you just access your progressive web app from a real mobile device.
